# MLB
This is a short Python script that gives you the latest boxscore or linescore for a given MLB team. 
It relies on the [statsapi wrapper by Todd Roberts](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI).

To use this script you need to install the wrapper first:
`pip install MLB-StatsAPI`
or for Python 3
`pip3 install MLB-StatsAPI`

Then just run the script from the command line and follow the directions. 

The script isn't very smart  at this point. To play it safe just use your desired team's name, and not the location, such as Yankees,
Blue Jays, Diamondbacks, Rangers, and so on.
