# MLB
This is a Python script that gives you some basic MLB information on the command line. It can show you the latest boxscore or linescore for a given MLB team; a list of upcoming games for your team; or the current standings for the AL, NL, or both. 

It relies on the [statsapi wrapper by Todd Roberts](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI).

To use this script you need to install the wrapper first:
`pip install MLB-StatsAPI`
or for Python 3
`pip3 install MLB-StatsAPI`

Then just run the script from the command line and follow the directions.
