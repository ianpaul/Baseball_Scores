# MLB
This is a short Python script that gives you the latest boxscore or linescore for a given MLB team. 
It relies on the [statsapi wrapper by Todd Roberts](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI).

To use this script you need to install the wrapper first:
`pip install MLB-StatsAPI`
or for Python 3
`pip3 install MLB-StatsAPI`

Then just run the script from the command line and follow the directions.
